# Poem Generator â€” Vietnamese "Luc Bat" Poetry with VinaLLaMA

This project uses AI to generate Vietnamese **Luc Bat** poems.  
It is built on the **VinaLLaMA** large language model, fine-tuned on a dataset of traditional Vietnamese Luc Bat poetry.

## Dataset & Training

The dataset was collected using **Selenium** from websites such as **thivien.net**, **lucbat.com**, and several available **public datasets**.

After collection, the data was **preprocessed**, cleaned, and normalized to follow the Luc Bat structure. The **VinaLLaMA** model was then fine-tuned to learn how to naturally extend Luc Bat poems while maintaining rhythm, rhyme, and poetic style.

The trained model can generate Luc Bat verses based on a single input line, preserving both rhyme and meaning.
